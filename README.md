# Connect-4-game-with-AI
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which players choose a color (Red or Yellow) and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
